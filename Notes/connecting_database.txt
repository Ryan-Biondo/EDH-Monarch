React Hook Form is good for form submission, tracking changes, and displaying validation errors
add {...register('Commander')} properties or wrap complex forms in a controller

use axios to connect the api
useRouter from next/navigation for actually sending the user to the next page

React select? for searchable commander dropdowns, maybe also use that for the other fields.
